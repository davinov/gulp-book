# Happy Gulpy life!

With all these recipes, we created in a small time all we need for our build pipeline, inspired by Brunch's I used before.
The aim of these tutorial is not to encourage to copy/paste all these tasks and replicate this model, but to show you how easy it is to write your own gulpfile and generate quickly the one that suits to your favorite project's organization.

Don't hesitate to send suggestions, comments, questions and stupid GIFs on [GitHub](https://github.com/davinov/gulp-book), by [email](mailto:david@nowinsky.net) or on twitter ([@davinov](https://twitter.com/davinov)). PR are welcome!

Many thanks to [@vbrajon](README.md), [@nicbaz](https://github.com/nicbaz) and [@thierrymarianne](https://twitter.com/thierrymarianne) for helping me working with Gulp @ [Theodo](http://theodo.fr).
I particularly invite you to have a look on vbrajon's projects [Plug](https://github.com/vbrajon/gulp-plug) (a dead simple utility around Gulp) and [angular-styleguide](https://github.com/vbrajon/angular-styleguide).
