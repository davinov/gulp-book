# Gulp basics

Gulp is a tool for developers. Wihile using it, you're intended to write code, not configuration.
Totally opposite it to Grunt that provides plugins that do a lot of things and have a giant amount of options, 
Gulp concentrates on giving you little helpers called plugins, that are supposed to do one and only one thing.

Gulp itself contains only a few fonctions to help you build your files. It's basically only the entry and the exit points of your factory, wired by tubes.

Let's over quickly the basics of Gulp:
- the Gulpfile
- the streaming system
- the tasks

You'll be sursprised to discover that there is no "advanced" of Gulp.
Following its motto, Gulp stays lean and provides you the very minimum to accomplish the task it was designed for:
build your files automatically.
