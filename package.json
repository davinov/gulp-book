  "description": "I'm excited everyday I write front-end code with these amazing tools we now have to build client-side apps with pleasure.  I liked JavaScript but typing so many brackets was killing my keyboard, then I discovered [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org).  I was desperately trying to rationalize my copy and paste activity for selectors in CSS, but that before [LESS](http://lesscss.org) saved my life. I got lost every time in the verbose HTML markup of long web pages, and couldn't stand losing time forgetting closing tags, so [Jade](http://jade-lang.com) felt like a spring cleaning to me.",
